# VOICE

⚠️ Work in Progress ⚠️


An iOS application to convert speech into text and text into speech. 

## What's Working
* Speech to text translation - tap the red button, say something into the mic, tap the red button again and the textfield should update with a translation of your recording.


## What's Left to do
* Styling: focused mostly on layout and getting the logic working, plan to go back and update the colors and fonts later. 
* Text to speech screen and logic
* Navigation between screens
* Menu 

## Nice to Have
* Shortcut screen for speaking commonly used recorded phrases. 

## Built With

* SwiftUI
* Speech Framework
